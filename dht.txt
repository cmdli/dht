Distributed Hash Table:

- Bunch of nodes in network
- Get k:
  - Ask nodes in network for k or nodes closer to k
- Put k:
  - Get nodes in network near k and ask them to hold k
- Overlay network:
  - Maintained references from node to node to speed up get/put
  - Typically logarithmic (nodes reference close nodes and exponentially farther nodes)
  - Allows O(log n) get/put

Implementation:
 - Get:
   - From routing table, get set of nodes near id
   - Query nodes for other nodes near id
   - Get closest nodes near id until finding node id
